## Running Tests

### Run all tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run specific test file
```bash

### Key design decisions

- **Page Object Model (POM)** — all page interactions are encapsulated in `pages/`, keeping test logic separate from UI interactions.
- **Shared Fixtures** — `utils/fixtures.js` extends Playwright's built-in fixtures to provide ready-to-use page objects, eliminating boilerplate in every spec.
- **Centralized Test Data** — `utils/testData.js` stores all URLs, expected error messages, and random data generators. No hardcoded values in test files.
- **Allure Annotations** — every test is tagged with `feature`, `story`, `description`, and `severity` for rich reporting.

## Test Cases

### Login (`login.spec.js`)
| # | Test | User | Expected |
|---|------|------|----------|
| TC1 | Successful login | `standard_user` | Redirect to inventory, products visible |
| TC2 | Locked out user | `locked_out_user` | Error message shown |
| TC3 | Broken product images | `problem_user` | All product images are the same (bug) |
| TC4 | Slow login | `performance_glitch_user` | Login takes > 1 second |
| TC5 | Remove from cart fails | `error_user` | Item stays in cart after remove |
| TC6 | Visual overlap bug | `visual_user` | Cart icon overlaps filter icon (known bug) |

### Cart (`cart.spec.js`)
| # | Test | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| TC1 | Add product to cart | Product appears in cart with correct name and quantity 1 |

### Checkout (`checkout.spec.js`)
| # | Test | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| TC1 | Complete checkout | Order confirmed with "Thank you for your order!" message |
